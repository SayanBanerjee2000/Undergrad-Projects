This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify and flag suspicious transactions by identifying patterns from historical data. The dataset contains detailed transaction records, including labelled instances of both fraud and legitimate activity. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where key transaction fields are cleaned and standardized for consistency.
In the modelling phase, Random Forest, a supervised learning model, is employed for its high accuracy and robustness, while Isolation Forest is used as an unsupervised anomaly detection technique. Thresholding is applied to fine-tune performance, particularly given the imbalanced nature of the dataset. The analysis reveals that Random Forest consistently outperforms other models in terms of key performance metrics. Although Isolation Forest shows improved accuracy with thresholding, it falls short in F1 score and recall.
To address this, a hybrid model named "IsoRandom" is proposed. In this approach, Isolation Forest is first used to detect and remove outliers, after which Random Forest is trained on
the cleaned dataset. This method combines the anomaly detection strength of Isolation Forest with the classification power of Random Forest.
In conclusion, Random Forest proves to be the most reliable standalone model for fraud detection in this scenario. However, the IsoRandom hybrid model presents a promising alternative, offering a unique and effective blend of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques for improved fraud detection performance.
In this project 1 signifies potential fraudulent transaction, whereas 0 means not a fraud.
