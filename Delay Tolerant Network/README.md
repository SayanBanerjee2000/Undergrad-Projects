This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of four key routing protocols in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs): Epidemic, Spray and Wait, ProPHET, and MaxProp. The analysis was conducted using the ONE (Opportunistic Network Environment) Simulator, a specialized tool for simulating DTN behavior. The primary goal was to identify the most efficient protocol in terms of delivery probability and overhead ratio under varying transmission times. Through simulation-based testing, the study revealed that MaxProp and Spray and Wait consistently offered superior performance, achieving higher delivery rates and lower overheads compared to the other protocols. Additionally, it was observed that the efficiency of all protocols improved with increased simulation time, highlighting the adaptive advantages of MaxProp and Spray and Wait in dynamic DTN environments.
