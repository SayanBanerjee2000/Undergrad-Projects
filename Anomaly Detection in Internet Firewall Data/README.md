The project presents a predictive anomaly detection system for firewall data using a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and deep learning techniques. It employs Isolation Forest for its efficiency in detecting outliers through recursive partitioning, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for its high accuracy in sequential learning and classification, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for their ability to analyze complex relationships in graph-structured network data. By focusing on the 'Action' attribute in firewall logs (allow/deny), the models are trained to detect irregular or potentially malicious connections. Among the three, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest performance across all key metrics—precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy—demonstrating its suitability for real-world cybersecurity applications. GNNs also showed strong results, particularly in capturing structural dependencies in network traffic, while Isolation Forest, though slightly lower in recall, offered robust precision and scalability. This study highlights the effectiveness of advanced analytics in proactively identifying cyber threats and enhancing digital infrastructure security.
