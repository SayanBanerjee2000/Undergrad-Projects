The project focused on the development of a student feedback system designed to facilitate feedback collection and result retrieval. This portal allows students to log in and provide feedback for their teachers based on a structured questionnaire. In addition to submitting feedback, students can also access their semester exam results and export them in PDF or CSV format. On the administrative side, teachers can view detailed feedback scores for each question—rated out of 5—along with an overall aggregate score. The portal also allows teachers to submit test scores for their respective subjects.
