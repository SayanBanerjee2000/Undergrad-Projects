An online e-commerce website developed for a shoe store with an integrated chatbot to enhance user experience. The website features categorized shoe listings and a search engine for streamlined browsing. Customers can register and log in to their accounts to view past orders, generate receipts, and place new orders. The integrated chatbot allows users to check order updates and inquire about product stock. The system includes two admin portals: the main admin portal monitors inventory and overall order management, while the sub-admin portal is responsible for updating stock based on requests raised by the admin. These requests appear automatically in the sub-adminâ€™s interface, and once addressed, the tickets are marked as closed. Additionally, the platform supports live chat assistance, where registered users can receive real-time support from the sub-admin. The project is locally hosted
